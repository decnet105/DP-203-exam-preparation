example question 1: You have 100 retail stores distributed across Asia, Europe, and North America.

You are developing an analytical workload that contains sales data for stores in different regions. The workload contains a fact table with the following columns:

Date: Contains the order date
Customer: Contains the customer ID
Store: Contains the store ID
Region Contains the region ID
Product: Contains the product ID
Price: Contains the unit price per product
Quantity: Contains the quantity sold
Amount: Contains the price multiplied by quantity
You need to design a partition solution for the fact table. The solution must meet the following requirements:

Optimize read performance when querying sales data for a single region in a given month.
Optimize read performance when querying sales data for all regions in a given month.
Minimize the number of partitions.
Which column should you use for partitioning?

a. Date partitioned by month

b. Region

c. Store

d. Product

Example question 2: You have an Azure Stream Analytics job named Job1. Job1 is configured to use one Streaming Unit (SU) and can be parallelized for up to three nodes.

You need to ensure there are three nodes available for the job.

What is the minimum number of SUs you should configure? a. 3 b. 6. c.18. d.24.

Example question 3: Question 61: You are managing a 20 TB data warehouse that is hosted in a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics. You need to tune queries by using the ideal indexing strategy to reach workload scenarios. The goal of tuning is to maximize the querying performance. Which index type should you select for each querying scenario?

Scenarios:

A: A temporary staging table that is written and read in full and only once

Options:

1.Heap
2. Clustered Index
3. Clustered Columnstore Index
4. Nonclustered Index

Example question 4: Same introduction as in question 3.

Scenario:

B: A fact table with 200 million records that is used for aggregate analytics in Power BI

Options:

1.Heap
2.Clustered Index
3.Clustered Columnstore Index
4.Nonclustered Index

Example question 5: Same introduction as in question 3.

Scenario:

C: A customer table with 10 million records, with queries typically looking up one or two specific customers by email, and which has a clustered index by customer id.

Options:

1. Heap
2. Clustered Index
3. Clustered Columnstore Index
4. Nonclustered Index
